# Introduction to Qualitative Research & Practice

**This is a seminar for Master's students in [SNU-HCIL](http://hcil.snu.ac.kr).**  

Being HCI researchers, we often encounter research topics which involves qualitative research methods. However, compared to quantitative analysis, how to conduct qualitative research is not well known to students. This seminar aims to help students learn it by performing 2-month-long group projects. The projects will include:

* Formal interview and user study (e.g., building questionaire, how to record it)
* Qualitative analysis (e.g., coding, thematic analysis)
* How to report the result in academic manners
